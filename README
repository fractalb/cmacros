This program is intended to interactively view/analyse macros in a C/C++ source.
This program doesn't expand or process macros. It just naively tries to
do string matching. As long as your macros are not complex it's enough.

Dependencies:
    - Python3.4 or above

To run: ./cmacros.py <path-to-a-C/C++-source-directory>
prompt looks like <Def:>. Press <Ctrl-D> to exit

Commands:

1. expr <text>
    lists macros which contain <text> in its expressions

2. body <text>
    lists macros which contain the given <text> in their bodies. (OR)
    lists macros which can expand to the given <text>

3. list <text>
    lists macros which contain the given <text> in its macro expression.
    lists all macros if no <text> is given.
